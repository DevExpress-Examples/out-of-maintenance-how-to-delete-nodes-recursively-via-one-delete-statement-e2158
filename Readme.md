# How to delete nodes recursively via one delete statement


<p>The ASPxTreeList doesn't allow you to remove nodes recursively in batch mode. When the delete button is clicked, the ASPxTreeList removes nested nodes one-by-one.<br />
This example demonstrates how this approach can be changed: all keys that should be deleted are collected, and then can be removed from the datasource using one delete statement (or query).</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>You can&#39;t set the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebDataASPxDataDeletingEventArgsMembersTopicAll">e.Cancel</a> property equal to false when performing a custom deleting. When the ASPxTreeList is notified that deleting is canceled, it stops the operation. To cancel the ASPxTreeList deleting mechanism, it should be interrupted with any exception.</p><p>Because the example uses the <i>DataTable</i>, the following exception is raised internally:<br />
<strong>NotSupportedException - &quot;Specified method is not supported.&quot;</strong></p><p>If you use other datasource, you can simply omit the <i>DeleteCommand</i> property declaration, and you&#39;ll get a similar exception that can also be handled by the ASPxTreeList.</p><p>If the exception isn&#39;t handled in the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebASPxTreeListASPxTreeList_NodeDeletedtopic">ASPxTreeList.NodeDeleted</a> event handler, the treelist will warn you with an alert.</p><p>All deleted keys are collected in a list in the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebASPxTreeListASPxTreeList_NodeDeletingtopic">ASPxTreeList.NodeDeleting</a> event handler. The ASPxTreeList removes its nodes starting from the most nested one. When deleting ends, the ASPxTreeList binds itself with the refreshed datasource.<br />
We should remove nodes using the collected keys before binding them: <i>ASPxTreeList.DataBinding</i> event handler is most suitable for this purpose.</p>
